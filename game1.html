      <h1>Rock Paper Scizzors</h1>
  <p> Published Project</p>
    <p class="game-description">I made this small game right after finishing GameDev TV’s 35 hour Udemy course. It took me 2 weeks from idea to publish. 

      I’ve learned a lot during this project. How to import my own made assets, how to make those assets to be useable in Unity. In this project, my wife was responsible for all of the art and we collaborated closely throughout the development. 
      
      The most important lesson was that even a really small UI system needs you to think things through.
      
      I was into gamedev alround 2 months I was able to build and publish a finished game to the Play Store in 2 weeks. By now it has alround 2000 downloads.</p>

        <p><span class="inline-heading">Engaging gameplay mechanics:</span> <span class="inline-text">Players test their reflexes and response times by quickly identifying and selecting the counter option (rock, paper, or scissors) out of three choices as they appear and move across the screen from right to left.</span></p>
        <p><span class="inline-heading">Art and design collaboration:</span> <span class="inline-text">Partnered with my wife, who was responsible for designing the cartoony, cute characters and visually appealing user interface, while I handled the implementation of animations, UI responses, and game programming.</span></p>
        <p><span class="inline-heading">Minimalist animation approach:</span> <span class="inline-text">Focused on clean, minimalist aesthetics by limiting animations to character faces, which adds a subtle charm to the overall game experience.</span></p>

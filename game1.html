      <h1>Rock Paper Scizzors</h1>
  <p> Published Project</p>
    <p class="game-description">I made this small game right after finishing GameDev TV’s 35 hour Udemy course. It took me 2 weeks from idea to publish. 

      I’ve learned a lot during this project. How to import my own made assets, how to make those assets to be useable in Unity. In this project, my wife was responsible for all of the art and we collaborated closely throughout the development. 
      
      The most important lesson was that even a really small UI system needs you to think things through.
      
      I’ve made a few mistakes what I wouldn’t do again. The main problem with this game is I randomly spawning the gameobjects and simply destroying them over time it gets laggy because of the garbage it generates. Back then I didn’t know about object pooling.
      
      Considering I was into gamedev alround 2 months I was able to publish a game to the Play Store in 2 weeks. By now it has alround 2000 downloads.</p>

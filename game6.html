    <p class="game-description"> The whole idea came from my former game, where I had implemented FPS elements in a tower defense game. It was basically the same concept, but in VR.

      I was and still am in love with VR. I specifically developed this game for the Oculus Quest 2. It's just amazing how even a simple scene with a simple game mechanic can be so much fun in VR.
      
      The idea for the theme was that enemies could only be defeated by opposite element attacks. It may sound silly, but the game was actually really fun to play.</p>

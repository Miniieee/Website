    <p class="game-description">This time I wanted to make a 100% made by me game. So in this one I draw, animated, programmed everything. It was fun to experience how to make animation from sprites, draw the individual animation frames, make the logic etc.

      The game itself not too complicated, basicly it coud be a rage game. The idea was that the player has to die to find the hidden traps all alround and the player bodies showed that there is a trap nearby.</p>

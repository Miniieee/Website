      <p class="game-description"> I started my journey into game development three years ago when I found Brackey's "How to make a video game" tutorial series. From the moment I saw a simple cube move, I knew that game development was my thing.</p>
      <p>After a year, I discovered my second passion, VR technology. I was impressed by its immersive capabilities, even simple games felt like a whole new level of engagement.</p>

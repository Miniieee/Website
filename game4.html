  <h1>Ghost Hunt Co-Op</h1>
  <p>In prototyping phase</p>
  <p class="game-description">
    Ghost Hunt Co-Op is a multiplayer co-op horror game inspired by Phasmophobia, where players take on the roles of ghost huntersâ€”and even the ghost is a playable character. In this prototype, we are building all equipment from scratch, from flashlights and temperature sensors to EMF readers and beyond. Our goal is to craft an immersive ghosthunting experience with innovative, handcrafted gameplay mechanics.

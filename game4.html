  <h1>Zombie Survivor</h1>
  <p> In development</p>
    <p class="game-description">Pixel Art Survivor is a 2D game where the player must survive in a post-apocalyptic world infested with zombies. The game is still in the early stages of development. 

      The pixel art for the game is currently being generated using Midjourney. I also use ChatGPT can assist with ideas and tips for pixel art creation.
      
      My main goal with this project is to improve my skills to write clean, easy to read, decoupled and code with refactoring frequently. 
      
      The game is being developed in Unity, and I am waiting for the release of Unity DOTS 1.0 to optimize the game for better performance.
      
      The project files can be found on GitHub.</p>

      <h1>Zombie Tower Defence</h1>
  <p> Published Project</p>
    <p class="game-description">After my first mini game, I wanted to create a more complex game. I have always loved playing tower defense games, but every time I played them, I wondered what it would be like to play in an FPS mode and also be the defender. This project took around 5 months to complete from scratch.

      During this project, I learned a lot. I was inspired by several game developer YouTubers such as Brackeys, Codemonkey, and Jason Weinmann. I added many features and modified the code to meet my specific needs. The features I designed, coded, and tested included the dropping system, reload animation, Unity ads implementation, and UI system. I also learned a lot about how to communicate between scripts, and I created the level design and menu design. My wife was my UI designer, she made all the visuals, so we collaborated on this aspect of the project.
      
      If I were to do this project again, I would change the lighting and implement object pooling. The lighting should have been done by baking to be more performant, especially on mobile platforms, and I would also switch to URP for the same reason.
      
      After a year and a half, I received around 1300 downloads, and the game did not perform as I thought it will.
      
      I think thereâ€™s multiple reasons for that.
      
      the in game UI is not trivial
      
      the balance was off
      
      the visuals might not mached too well</p>
